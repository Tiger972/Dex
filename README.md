# Dex
A simple decentralized exchange (DEX) built with Solidity and Foundry. It allows users to add liquidity, remove liquidity, and swap between ETH and an ERC20 token. This project includes a custom ERC20 token, full smart contract deployment on Sepolia, and live interaction tests using Foundry and Cast.
